# Chest-X-rays-Image-Captioning-Project
Utilizing Deep Learning to generate accurate, automated clinical descriptions from chest X-ray scans, helping users quickly understand radiological findings with high precision.

* This project demonstrates the implementation of a Deep Learning model to solve a real-world problem using Computer Vision / NLP techniques.
* The system takes raw input data and produces intelligent predictions through a trained neural network.

* It is designed as an end-to-end pipeline starting from data preprocessing up to model deployment.

✅ Data preprocessing & augmentation
✅ Deep Learning model training
✅ Model evaluation & visualization
✅ Real-time or batch prediction
✅ Deployment ready (Flask / API / App)

🛠 Technologies Used
* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Flask (for deployment)
* Jupyter Notebook

📊 Results
The model achieves high accuracy on validation data and demonstrates strong generalization on unseen samples.
Evaluation metrics include:
